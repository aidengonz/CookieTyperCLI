# CookieTyperCLI
A cookie clicker type game made with nim. Play in the command line. 1, 2, 3, or 4 are the optional inputs.

1 = Make cookies.
2 = Buy upgrades.
3 = End game.
4 = Random Help or Hurt
If you try to buy an upgrade without enough cookies you go bankrupt and the game is over.

To play write the following in your terminal:
``` nim compile --verbosity:0 --hints:off --run "/Users/user/Downloads/CookieTyperCLI-main/cookieclicker.nim" ```

Change /Users/user/Downloads to where ever the file is.

If you download the zip file it should be in Downloads if you are on MAC OS.
